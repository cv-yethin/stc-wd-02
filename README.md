# Stopwatch Web App

A simple stopwatch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports starting the timer by clicking anywhere on the screen, pausing, resetting with a reverse-time animation, and tracking laps that slide in smoothly from the right side of the interface. The layout is clean and minimal, with attention to smooth transitions and subtle effects.

## Features

- Click anywhere on the window to start the stopwatch.
- Reset function plays a reverse-timer animation before returning to zero.
- Smooth transitions and modern UI styling.

## How to Use

1. Load the page in your browser.
2. Click anywhere on the screen to start the stopwatch.
3. Use the pause button to temporarily stop the timer.
4. Use the reset button to reverse the timer and return to zero.
5. Use the lap button to log the current time into the lap list on the right side.
